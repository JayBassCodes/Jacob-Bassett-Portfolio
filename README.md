# Jacob-Bassett-Portfolio

## Collection of Jacob Bassett's work as a web developer.

My name is Jacob Bassett and this web page is my personal repository of work that i want to display to employers and business partners. Currently you will first notice the styling after the Philadelphia Eagles' logo color scheme. Across to the right is a navigation bar to take you to the different sections of the page. First up for the main content is a short bio about myself followed by a card style display of links to all of my different works. Finally, at the bottom, the footer has my contact info.
