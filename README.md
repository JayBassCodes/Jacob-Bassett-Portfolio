# Jacob-Bassett-Portfolio

## Collection of Jacob Bassett's work as a web developer.

My name is Jacob Bassett and this web page is my personal repository of work that i want to display to employers and business partners. Currently, you will first notice the styling after the Philadelphia Eagles' logo color scheme. You can also see my name and placeholder image for an avatar on the left. Across to the right is a navigation bar to take you to the different sections of the page. First up for the main content is a short bio about myself followed by a card style display of links to all of my different works. Finally, at the bottom, the footer has my contact info.
